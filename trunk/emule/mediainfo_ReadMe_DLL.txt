For software developers
-----------------------
You can use it as you want (example: without this text file, without sources),
but a reference to "http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net" in your software would be appreciated.

There are examples for:
- BCB: Borland C++ Builder 6
- Delphi: Borland Delphi 10 (aka 2005)
- MSCS: Microsoft C# 8 (aka 2005)
- MSJS: Microsoft J# 8 (aka 2005)
- MSVB: Microsoft Visual Basic 8 (aka 2005)
- MSVC: Microsoft Visual C++ 8 (aka 2005)
Don't forget to put MediaInfo.Dll and Example.ogg in your executable folder.

Note: for C++ users, .lib files can be found in "Developpers/Release" Directory

Note: for Visual Studio 7 (aka 2002) or 7.1 (aka 2003), you can edit .sln and .xxproj to be compatible.
- .sln: "...Format Version 9.00" to "7.00"
- .xxproj: "Version="8.00" to "7.00"
This is not always tested, but examples files are only a template, you can easily adapt them to your compiler
Note: I can't handle all versions of all compilers, so I look for maintainers for examples.

Note: versioning method, for people who develop with LoadLibrary method
- if one of 2 first numbers change, there is no guaranties that the DLL is compatible with old one. You should verify with MediaInfo_Option("Version") if you are compatible
- if one of 2 last numbers change, there is a guaranty that the DLL is compatible with old one.
So you should test the version of the DLL, and if one of the 2 first numbers change, not load it.
